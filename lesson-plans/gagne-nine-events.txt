**Theory name: Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction**

**Topic**: Completing the Graduation Rates Survey for IPEDS

**Learners**: Postsecondary administrators or institutional research staff tasked with IPEDS Graduation Rates survey completion

**Learning Objective**:

1. (LO1) Identify each step involved in completing the IPEDS Graduation Rates survey.
2. (LO2) Accurately enter and review institutional data in the IPEDS system.
3. (LO3) Apply correct review procedures and submit the survey for final lock.

**Steps for Instruction**

**1. Gain Attention**

**Activity**: Use high-impact, real-world visuals to demonstrate the importance of IPEDS accuracy.

- **Preparation**: Prepare visuals such as a news article or government website showing how IPEDS data affects public perception and funding, and a short video highlighting the impact of incorrect data.
- **Instruction**: Show the visuals and video to trigger interest and establish relevance (supports LO1, LO2).

**2. Inform Learners of Objectives**

**Activity**: Present the learning objectives and invite predictions.

- **Preparation**: Create a slide clearly listing the learning objectives.
- **Instruction**: Present objectives starting with “By the end of this training, you will be able to…” Ask learners to predict steps or challenges in completing the Graduation Rates survey. This provides structure and context for what is coming (supports LO1–LO3).

**3. Stimulate Recall of Prior Knowledge**

**Activity**: Connect new content with learners’ existing mental models.

- **Preparation**: Prepare a brief discussion prompt and a College Navigator screenshot of their institution’s public data.
- **Instruction**: Ask learners if they have entered compliance data before and what made it easier or harder. Show the screenshot and discuss what data errors might imply (supports LO2).

**4. Present the Stimulus Material**

**Activity**: Introduce the survey process with visual and modular content.

- **Preparation**: Create a step-by-step diagram of the IPEDS survey process segmented into four modules: (1) Identifying the correct cohort, (2) Entering graduation data, (3) Reviewing for accuracy, and (4) Locking and submitting.
- **Instruction**: Deliver the content logically and efficiently, focusing on skill-building (supports LO1, LO2).

**5. Provide Learner Guidance**

**Activity**: Scaffold learners through the process.

- **Preparation**: Develop narrated walkthroughs, annotated screenshots, decision trees for tricky scenarios, checklists, and field definition handouts.
- **Instruction**: Guide learners through each IPEDS section with these supports (supports LO2, LO3).

**6. Elicit Performance**

**Activity**: Have learners practice completing sections of the survey.

- **Preparation**: Create dummy data and partial IPEDS survey sections for practice.
- **Instruction**: Learners complete scenario-based entries after each module, such as “What should be entered if a student withdrew after 90 days?” This builds fluency in a low-stakes environment (supports LO2).

**7. Provide Feedback**

**Activity**: Offer immediate and constructive feedback.

- **Preparation**: Prepare automated feedback for knowledge checks and guidelines for instructor or peer review during activities.
- **Instruction**: Deliver feedback during practice, explaining why correct or incorrect entries matter (supports LO2, LO3).

**8. Assess Performance**

**Activity**: Administer a final performance assessment.

- **Preparation**: Create a fillable mock Graduation Rates survey form with built-in checks and a scoring rubric.
- **Instruction**: Learners complete the full survey simulation, evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to process (directly measures LO1–LO3).

**9. Enhance Retention and Transfer**

**Activity**: Assign tasks to support long-term application.

- **Preparation**: Prepare case studies of common IPEDS errors, SOP templates, and job aids.
- **Instruction**: Have learners identify and correct errors in case studies, build their own SOP for survey preparation, and reflect on learning goals. Provide job aids and invite learners to quarterly refreshers before reporting deadlines (supports LO3).

**Explanation of Instruction**

This instructional design is grounded in **Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction**, a sequenced framework that aligns external instructional strategies with internal cognitive processes to optimize learning. The lesson begins by **gaining learners’ attention** with real-world examples of how IPEDS data affects institutional reputation and funding. This is followed by a clear **statement of objectives**, giving learners a road map of what they will achieve (LO1–LO3). To **stimulate recall** of prior knowledge, learners reflect on their past experiences with data reporting and compliance, connecting their background to new IPEDS tasks.

Next, the instruction moves into the **acquire-and-**practice** phase**, where the IPEDS Graduation Rates survey process is **presented** in structured modules. Learners are **guided** through the content with annotated screenshots, checklists, and decision trees, providing the **scaffolding** needed to support understanding (LO2). Learners are then asked to **practice** completing segments of the survey using dummy data in a low-risk setting (LO2), followed by targeted **feedback** that highlights both correct logic and common pitfalls (LO3). Once confident, learners move on to a summative **performance assessment**, completing a full survey simulation using provided scenarios and a scoring rubric to measure accuracy and process alignment (LO1–LO3).

To conclude, the training supports **retention** and **transfer** by offering real-world case studies, opportunities for reflection, and tools learners can carry into their future work.
