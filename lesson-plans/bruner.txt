Instructional Design: IPEDS Survey Completion Using Jerome Bruner’s Constructivist Learning Theory
Focused Strategies: Discovery Learning & Spiral Curriculum

Target Learners: Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

Learning Objectives:
By the end of this training, learners will be able to:
1. Identify the required components and deadlines of the IPEDS survey.
2. Complete a mock IPEDS data entry task using provided institutional data.
3. Revise submitted survey entries based on feedback and peer discussion.

I. Discovery Learning
A. Guided Exploration of IPEDS Components
• Learners receive access to an interactive IPEDS glossary and data dictionary.
• Using a structured scavenger hunt activity:
    o Locate definitions for 10 key IPEDS terms.
    o Identify where each term appears in the survey and note any related deadlines.
    o Record examples from sample datasets that match each definition.
• Assessment (LO1):
Learners compile a completed glossary sheet linking IPEDS terms to their survey locations, deadlines, and real-world examples.

B. Case Analysis: “The Reporting Challenge”
• Scenario: Learners read a short narrative about a fictional college that missed a reporting deadline and submitted inaccurate data.
• Group task:
    o Identify what information was missing.
    o Propose strategies to prevent similar errors in the future.
    o Map errors to the correct IPEDS terms and components.
• Assessment (LO1):
Learners submit a group action plan outlining prevention strategies and term clarifications.

II. Spiral Curriculum
A. Building Complexity Over Time
• Learners revisit core IPEDS components multiple times across different activities:
    o First in glossary and scavenger hunt.
    o Again in the case analysis.
    o Finally in a hands-on mock submission.
• Each revisit increases complexity—starting with definitions, moving to application, and ending with revision based on feedback.

B. Mock IPEDS Submission & Review
• Using a sample dataset from a fictional institution:
    o Learners independently complete a simplified IPEDS section.
    o Learners submit their work for peer review using a provided rubric.
• Peer feedback cycle:
    o Review partner’s submission for accuracy, terminology use, and formatting.
    o Provide constructive suggestions.
• Assessment (LO2 & LO3):
Learners revise their submissions using peer feedback and resubmit final versions for instructor review.

III. Reflection & Knowledge Integration
A. Reflection Journal:
• Prompt:
“What patterns or rules did you notice while navigating IPEDS requirements? How did revisiting concepts over time affect your understanding?”
• Submission:
    o Learners submit a short written reflection or voice memo.
    o Opportunity to identify personal learning strategies for IPEDS reporting.

EXPLANATION OF INSTRUCTION
This instructional design applies Jerome Bruner’s Constructivist Learning Theory by emphasizing discovery learning and the spiral curriculum. Learners actively construct meaning through guided exploration of key IPEDS terms and processes, uncovering relationships between concepts instead of memorizing static definitions. The spiral curriculum reinforces understanding by revisiting the same concepts in increasingly complex contexts—from glossary exercises to real-world case analysis to mock submissions. This iterative approach ensures that learners develop a deep, flexible understanding of IPEDS requirements, equipping them to apply this knowledge confidently in real reporting situations.
