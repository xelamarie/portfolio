**Theory name: Jerome Bruner’s Constructivist Learning Theory**

**Topic**: Completing the Graduation Rates Survey for IPEDS

**Learners**: Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

**Learning Objective**:
By the end of this training, learners will be able to:
1. Identify the required components and deadlines of the IPEDS survey.
2. Complete a mock IPEDS data entry task using provided institutional data.
3. Revise submitted survey entries based on feedback and peer discussion.

**1. Discovery Learning**
- **Activity**: Guided Exploration of IPEDS Components
• Learners receive access to an interactive IPEDS glossary and data dictionary.
• Using a structured scavenger hunt activity:
    o Locate definitions for 10 key IPEDS terms.
    o Identify where each term appears in the survey and note any related deadlines.
    o Record examples from sample datasets that match each definition.
• Assessment (LO1):
Learners compile a completed glossary sheet linking IPEDS terms to their survey locations, deadlines, and real-world examples.

- **Activity**: Case Analysis: “The Reporting Challenge”
• Scenario: Learners read a short narrative about a fictional college that missed a reporting deadline and submitted inaccurate data.
• Group task:
    o Identify what information was missing.
    o Propose strategies to prevent similar errors in the future.
    o Map errors to the correct IPEDS terms and components.
• Assessment (LO1):
Learners submit a group action plan outlining prevention strategies and term clarifications.

**2. Spiral Curriculum**
- **Activity**: Building Complexity Over Time
• Learners revisit core IPEDS components multiple times across different activities:
    o First in glossary and scavenger hunt.
    o Again in the case analysis.
    o Finally in a hands-on mock submission.
• Each revisit increases complexity—starting with definitions, moving to application, and ending with revision based on feedback.

- **Activity**: Mock IPEDS Submission & Review
• Using a sample dataset from a fictional institution:
    o Learners independently complete a simplified IPEDS section.
    o Learners submit their work for peer review using a provided rubric.
• Peer feedback cycle:
    o Review partner’s submission for accuracy, terminology use, and formatting.
    o Provide constructive suggestions.
• Assessment (LO2 & LO3):
Learners revise their submissions using peer feedback and resubmit final versions for instructor review.

**3. Reflection & Knowledge Integration**
- **Activity**: Reflection Journal:
• - **Prompt**:
“What patterns or rules did you notice while navigating IPEDS requirements? How did revisiting concepts over time affect your understanding?”
• - **Submission**:
    o Learners submit a short written reflection or voice memo.
    o Opportunity to identify personal learning strategies for IPEDS reporting.

**Explanation of Instruction**
Then, learners engage with new terminology through guided instruction, short-response prompts, and real-world examples. This allows them to define terms in both **symbolic** and **practical** ways.

Next, the instruction moves into **applied meaning-making** as learners **classify** mock student data using the correct IPEDS categories. Finally, learners complete actual excerpts of the IPEDS survey using **symbolic** codes and definitions. This applied task reflects **Bruner**’s emphasis on **learning through interaction** with **structured symbols**, encouraging learners to internalize language through use. The reflection at the end reinforces **schema construction** and helps solidify how **symbolic** accuracy leads to effective survey reporting. The lesson uses the **symbolic** representation not only to convey knowledge but to enable learners to perform the tasks they will encounter in their roles with confidence.
