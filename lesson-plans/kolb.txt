IPEDS Survey Training – David Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory
Focused Strategies: Concrete Experience & Active Experimentation
Target Learners: Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will be able to:
1. Identify the required components and deadlines of the IPEDS survey.
2. Complete a mock IPEDS data entry task using provided institutional data.
3. Revise submitted survey entries based on feedback and peer discussion.

I. Concrete Experience

A. Kickoff Case Study – “Meet Riverview Community College” (20 minutes)
Learners are introduced to a fictional community college with:
- Institutional profile and background narrative
- Organizational chart showing reporting roles
- Internal coordinator notes
- Sample calendar of deadlines

Activity:
- Annotate a digital reporting calendar with critical due dates.
- Mark up an internal checklist for upcoming IPEDS responsibilities.

Assessment (LO1): Learners identify core IPEDS components and deadlines by completing the checklist and calendar based on the case study.

B. Walkthrough of Past Reporting Errors (15 minutes)
Learners review three anonymized IPEDS submission mistakes, including:
- A description of what went wrong
- Original data vs. corrected versions
- References to the IPEDS instructions for verification

Small-Group Task:
- Identify misreported elements (e.g., staff categories, enrollment timing).
- Suggest accurate revisions using official IPEDS definitions.

Assessment (LO1): In a collaborative worksheet, learners identify three required components that were misreported and propose corrections.

II. Active Experimentation

A. Mock IPEDS Submission Task (25 minutes)
- Each learner is assigned a simplified IPEDS section (e.g., Fall Enrollment or Finance).
- Using Riverview’s mock dataset:
  - Complete an interactive form modeled after the IPEDS platform.
  - Use the IPEDS data dictionary and help guide as needed.

Assessment (LO2): Learners complete their assigned section and submit it for peer review.

B. Peer Review & Feedback Loop (20 minutes)
- Peer Assignments: Each learner is assigned a partner’s mock submission.
- Feedback Tasks:
  - Review formatting, data accuracy, and terminology use using a structured rubric.
  - Provide constructive written comments.
- Follow-up:
  - Discuss feedback in short breakout sessions or via a guided forum.
  - Revise original submissions accordingly.

Assessment (LO3): Learners resubmit revised work for instructor review.

C. Final Reflection (Optional Extension – 5 minutes)
Prompt: “What parts of the IPEDS reporting process felt most intuitive? Which steps need more tools or clarity?”
Submission: Written reflection or voice memo summarizing key takeaways.

Explanation of Instruction
This lesson applies Kolb’s Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation phases by immersing learners in a realistic scenario before asking them to apply their knowledge in practical tasks. The fictional “Riverview Community College” case study offers a tangible, context-rich entry point for identifying deadlines and components without starting from abstract definitions. Learners then move into hands-on experimentation, completing and refining a mock IPEDS submission based on peer review. This sequence mirrors workplace tasks and provides a safe space for trial, feedback, and revision—ensuring that participants leave with both procedural knowledge and applied skills for IPEDS reporting.
