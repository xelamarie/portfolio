**Theory name: David Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory**
**Focused Strategies**: Concrete Experience & Active Experimentation
**Learners**: Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

**Learning Objective**:
By the end of this training, participants will be able to:
1. Identify the required components and deadlines of the IPEDS survey.
2. Complete a mock IPEDS data entry task using provided institutional data.
3. Revise submitted survey entries based on feedback and peer discussion.

**1. Concrete Experience**

- **Activity**: Kickoff Case Study – “Meet Riverview Community College” (20 minutes)
Learners are introduced to a fictional community college with:
- Institutional profile and background narrative
- Organizational chart showing reporting roles
- Internal coordinator notes
- Sample calendar of deadlines

- **Activity**:
- Annotate a digital reporting calendar with critical due dates.
- Mark up an internal checklist for upcoming IPEDS responsibilities.

Assessment (LO1): Learners identify core IPEDS components and deadlines by completing the checklist and calendar based on the case study.

- **Activity**: Walkthrough of Past Reporting Errors (15 minutes)
Learners review three anonymized IPEDS submission mistakes, including:
- A description of what went wrong
- Original data vs. corrected versions
- References to the IPEDS instructions for verification

- **Small-Group Task**:
- Identify misreported elements (e.g., staff categories, enrollment timing).
- Suggest accurate revisions using official IPEDS definitions.

Assessment (LO1): In a collaborative worksheet, learners identify three required components that were misreported and propose corrections.

**2. Active Experimentation**

- **Activity**: Mock IPEDS Submission Task (25 minutes)
- Each learner is assigned a simplified IPEDS section (e.g., Fall Enrollment or Finance).
- Using Riverview’s mock dataset:
  - Complete an interactive form modeled after the IPEDS platform.
  - Use the IPEDS data dictionary and help guide as needed.

Assessment (LO2): Learners complete their assigned section and submit it for peer review.

- **Activity**: Peer Review & Feedback Loop (20 minutes)
- Peer Assignments: Each learner is assigned a partner’s mock submission.
- Feedback Tasks:
  - Review formatting, data accuracy, and terminology use using a structured rubric.
  - Provide constructive written comments.
- - **Follow-up**:
  - Discuss feedback in short breakout sessions or via a guided forum.
  - Revise original submissions accordingly.

Assessment (LO3): Learners resubmit revised work for instructor review.

- **Activity**: Final Reflection (Optional Extension – 5 minutes)
- **Prompt**: “What parts of the IPEDS reporting process felt most intuitive? Which steps need more tools or clarity?”
- **Submission**: Written reflection or voice memo summarizing key takeaways.

**Explanation of Instruction**
This instructional design is grounded in **David Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory**, with a focus on **Concrete Experience** and **Active Experimentation**. The lesson begins by immersing participants in a fictional but **realistic** institutional scenario (Riverview Community College). This **Concrete Experience** gives learners a **hands-on** starting point by allowing them to explore institutional profiles, key deadlines, and documentation used for reporting. Instead of beginning with abstract definitions, learners interact with recognizable, **context-specific materials** to uncover IPEDS components and reporting structures. This supports the learning objective where they identify key terms and reporting cycles.

From there, the instruction shifts to **Active Experimentation**, where learners directly apply what they’ve learned. Using a simplified dataset, participants work through the process of completing a mock IPEDS survey. Afterward, they revise their submission based on structured peer feedback. This **trial-and-error** application allows learners to reflect on their decisions and improve their accuracy in a safe, **collaborative** setting. By moving from **realistic** experience to **hands-on** problem solving, the lesson ensures that learners not only understand IPEDS requirements, but are also better prepared to perform these tasks independently in the workplace.
