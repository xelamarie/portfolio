**Theory name:** Self-Regulated Learning

**Topic**: Completing the Graduation Rates Survey for IPEDS

**Learners**: Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

**Learning Objective**:
By the end of this training, participants will be able to:
LO1. Set clear goals to guide IPEDS data reporting tasks.
LO2. Apply appropriate strategies to plan, monitor, and complete IPEDS survey components.
LO3. Reflect on their performance and identify ways to improve IPEDS reporting processes in future cycles.
 
**Instructional Strategies**
• Goal-Setting and Planning – Learners define personal and task-specific goals.
• Strategy Use and Monitoring – Activities prompt learners to select and apply strategies, then evaluate their effectiveness.
• Self-Assessment and Reflection – Reflection prompts and checklists foster deeper awareness of learning and performance.
• Motivation and Self-Efficacy Support – Training includes autonomy, small successes, and relevance to real-world tasks.
• Differentiation and Learner Control – Learners make choices about task format and pacing to meet their needs.
• Contextual Application – Activities bridge classroom and real-world IPEDS work using collaborative and digital tools.
 
**Learning Activities**
• Goal Mapping Exercise (assesses LO1) – Learners set their goals for improving IPEDS practices using prompts and templates.
• Think-Aloud Strategy Walkthrough  – Paired learners verbalize their approach to a reporting task using monitoring checklists. 
• Guided IPEDS Reporting Task (assesses LO2) – Participants complete a short IPEDS entry by applying pre-set strategies and then receive **feedback**.
• Reflection Journal (assesses LO3) – Learners reflect on what strategies worked, what didn’t, and how they’ll adapt for future cycles.
• Self-Assessment Survey (supports LO3) – Learners reflect on and rate their effort and outcomes against the training’s success criteria and discuss in groups*.
 
**Assessment Methods**
Formative Assessments:
• Goal Maps – Evaluated for alignment with reporting needs, showing evidence that learners set clear goals (LO1).
• Think-Alouds – Observed to see how learners apply appropriate strategies (LO2).
• Checklists During Guided Task – Used to track strategy application and task monitoring (LO2).
Summative Assessment:
• Reflection Journal – Analyzed for evidence of performance evaluation and planned improvement (LO3).
• Mini IPEDS Submission – Learners complete a small-scale IPEDS task, showing their ability to apply strategies (LO2) and use their initial goals (LO1) to guide reporting.
 
**Evaluation of Training Impact**
• Post-Session Survey – Captures changes in self-efficacy, goal clarity, and confidence in using SRL strategies.
• Journal Review – Looks for growth in reflection and strategy awareness over time.
• Optional Follow-Up – Participants share if and how they applied SRL tools in real IPEDS tasks 2–4 weeks post-training.
 
 *Group Formation Challenge Addressed: Learners who struggle with social dynamics may feel anxious in group settings, disrupting motivation and reflection.
Solution:
• Choice in Collaboration Style: Offer two tracks—one collaborative and one more independent—but both still include peer check-ins or discussion forums. This supports learner agency while maintaining SRL principles.
• Group Entry Journals: Have students write a quick reflection before grouping on what they need to thrive in a team. Instructors use this to form groups that consider personality, communication style, and confidence.
• Mid-Project Peer Coaching: Include structured peer coaching where students give and receive **feedback** not just on the task, but on their collaboration strategies, deepening both SRL and interpersonal awareness.

EXPLANATION OF INSTRUCTION

This training is grounded in Self-Regulated Learning and is built to help learners take ownership of the IPEDS reporting process from start to finish. The lesson begins by guiding participants through **goal-setting and planning**, using prompts and checklists to define their own learning goals and keep them visible throughout the lesson. As learners move through scaffolded activities, they engage in **strategy use and monitoring**, selecting and applying approaches for real IPEDS tasks. Paired think-alouds and collaborative problem-solving encourage learners to verbalize and adjust their strategies in real time.

The design incorporates **self-assessment and reflection** activities like prompts and checklists to help learners think about what they’re learning and how they’re improving. It also supports **motivation and self-efficacy** by allowing learners to make meaningful choices, experience early wins, and work on tasks that feel relevant. Learners also have **differentiation and learner control** with choices in task format, pacing, and collaboration style. To address group work dynamics, participants select between a collaborative or more independent track, and complete group entry journals to reflect on their needs before being grouped. A mid-project peer coaching activity allows learners to give and receive **feedback** not just on the task, but on how they're learning. These strategies, combined with **contextual application** through real-world scenarios, help learners build lasting skills.
