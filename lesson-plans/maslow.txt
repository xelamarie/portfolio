**Theory name:** Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
**Topic:** Instructional Design for IPEDS Survey Completion Inspired by Alexander Hamilton**
**Target Audience:** Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

**Learning Objectives**
By the end of this training, participants will be able to:
• LO1: Interpret the structure and categories of the IPEDS survey using institutional language.
• LO2: Collaborate with peers to complete IPEDS sections accurately and efficiently.
• LO3: Reflect on how accurate reporting supports institutional integrity and broader educational goals.

**Instructional Strategies**
• Address **Physiological and Safety Needs**: Provide a clear, calm training environment with structured pacing and resource access.
• **Foster Belonging**: Use group work and storytelling to make participants feel part of a learning community.
• Support Esteem and Confidence: Scaffold tasks for early wins and use celebratory feedback à la Hamilton’s “I’m not throwing away my shot.”
• Promote **Cognitive Engagement**: Introduce case-based scenarios from real IPEDS reporting mistakes and let learners solve them.
• Incorporate **Aesthetic Elements**: Use Hamilton-style lyrical phrasing or rhythm-infused visuals to reinforce key concepts.
• Encourage **Self-Actualization**: Include open-ended challenges asking learners how they might improve institutional reporting processes.
• Inspire **Transcendence**: Emphasize how data transparency contributes to public trust in education, echoing Hamilton’s legacy of accountability and vision.

**Learning Activities**
• “Write Your Way In” Warm-Up (supports Maslow’s base needs): Learners journal about a time when data impacted a decision they cared about. It lowers affective filters and creates an open reflective space.
• Peer Partnership Breakouts (assesses LO2): Participants are assigned to duos (“duel teams”) to complete a practice IPEDS table in collaboration. They compare decisions, identify discrepancies, and improve data consistency.
• Reporting Showcase (assesses LO1): Small groups present on one survey component using stylized visuals and mnemonic-rich phrases, demonstrating accurate interpretation of structure and terminology.
• Hamilton Quote Walk (supports confidence, cognition, and aesthetics): Participants rotate around stations with quotes from the musical paired with data ethics prompts—e.g., “Who lives, who dies, who tells your data story?”
• Vision Forward Reflection (assesses LO3): Learners write a short “Data Federalist Paper” reflection describing how improved IPEDS reporting can better serve their institution and contribute to the greater good.

**Assessment Methods**
Formative Assessments:
• Feedback forms after collaborative tasks (supports LO2)
• Peer assessments on Reporting Showcase presentations
• Rubrics for scenario-based decision tasks, checking for correct interpretation (supports LO1)
Summative Assessment:
• Final project: Teams collaborate and submit a mock IPEDS entry and written rationale/interpretation connecting data choices to institutional goals (assesses LO1 and LO2).
• Individual reflections on how reporting accuracy contributes to institutional trust and mission (assesses LO3).

**Evaluation of Training Impact**
• Post-training survey measuring belonging, confidence, and clarity
• Self-assessment checklist aligned with Maslow’s motivational stages
• Optional follow-up: Each participant submits one proposed improvement for their department’s IPEDS process

**EXPLANATION OF INSTRUCTION**

This instructional design is based on **Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs** and brings in the relentless drive and imaginative energy of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s portrayal of Alexander Hamilton. Right from the beginning, learners are supported through addressing **physiological and safety needs** by establishing a structured, well-resourced training space that sets a calm but confident tone. As the lesson progresses, learners connect with each other through collaborative challenges and storytelling, helping to **foster belonging** and create a sense of shared mission.

Like Hamilton stepping onto the stage of history, participants are given chances to **build esteem and confidence** through scaffolded activities and affirming feedback that parallels Hamilton’s motto, “I am not throwing away my shot.” Engaging tasks built around real reporting missteps promote **cognitive engagement**, while **aesthetic elements**, such as lyric-inspired prompts or rhythm-based visuals, add a creative, memorable touch. The instructional experience ends in reflective writing and vision-setting to encourage **self-actualization** and inspire **transcendence**, reminding learners that accurate data isn’t just compliance–it’s part of something larger.
