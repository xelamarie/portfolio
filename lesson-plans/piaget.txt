**Theory name: Jean Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development (Preoperational Stage)**

**Topic**: Completing the Graduation Rates Survey for IPEDS

**Learners**: Preoperational Stage (Ages 2–7)

**Learning Objective**:

1. Learners will name the parts of an IPEDS survey form using visual prompts.
2. Learners will match each part of the IPEDS survey with a picture that shows what it does.

**Steps for Instruction**

**1. Introduction – Set the Stage with a Story**

**Activity**: Introduce the lesson with a puppet character to create context.

- **Preparation**: Create a short puppet story titled "Penny the Penguin Prepares a Report!" Prepare a large envelope labeled “IPEDS form.”
- **Instruction**: Begin by telling the story of Penny receiving the IPEDS form but not knowing what is inside. Ask learners to help Penny discover what the different parts of the form mean. This supports symbolic learning and role play by using a relatable character.

**2. Objective 1 Instructional Activity – Name the Parts**

**Activity**: Identify and name each part of the IPEDS survey form.

- **Preparation**: Prepare a large, colorful printout of a pretend “IPEDS Form” with labels such as “Student Numbers,” “Faculty List,” and “Program Types.” Provide finger puppets or stickers to represent each section.
- **Instruction**: Show each section to learners and repeat the names out loud. Encourage learners to point to sections while saying their names.
- **Assessment**: Learners take turns pointing to each section and saying its name. Learning Objective 1 is assessed through verbal recall and pointer play.

**3. Objective 2 Instructional Activity – Matching Game**

**Activity**: Match parts of the IPEDS survey form with related images.

- **Preparation**: Create laminated cards with three labeled parts of the IPEDS survey and three corresponding images (e.g., students in a classroom, a professor with a name tag, pictures of certificates).
- **Instruction**: Learners work in small groups to match each survey part with the correct picture. Prompt them with questions like, “Which picture goes with the part that talks about people teaching?”
- **Assessment**: After practicing in groups, learners are given individual sets and asked to match each survey part with the correct picture. Learning Objective 2 is assessed through a tactile, visual game.

**4. Review and Reinforcement**

**Activity**: Reinforce learning by having learners help Penny complete her IPEDS form.

- **Preparation**: Prepare the puppet and envelope for a final activity.
- **Instruction**: Penny returns to thank the learners. Learners tape the pictures and names onto Penny’s IPEDS envelope. Ask reinforcing questions such as, “What part did we name with all the students?” and “Can you match the one that tells about what teachers do?”

**Explanation of Instruction**

This lesson is built around **Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development**, focusing on how young learners in the **Preoperational Stage** think and learn. Since kids at this stage learn best through **pictures**, **play**, and **talking things out**, the lesson design plays to those strengths. We introduced IPEDS with a puppet character named “Penny the Penguin,” using symbolic **play** and **storytelling** to make a pretty abstract idea feel more concrete and fun. Penny helps walk the learners through what each section of the survey is about, using simple language and clear **visuals**.

We used **symbolic representation** by connecting each part of the IPEDS survey to an image, like a schoolhouse for institutional info or a stack of books for program data, so learners can start to name and recognize them. They get to show what they’ve learned in a matching activity where they identify and pair images with their names. It’s **hands-on**, playful, and just right for how learners at this age make sense of new things. We also built in chances for **repetition** and **discussion** to help ideas stick, which matches how their thinking is still developing and benefits from hearing and seeing things multiple times.
