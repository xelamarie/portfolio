**Theory name:** Social Interdependence Theory

**Topic**: Completing the Graduation Rates Survey for IPEDS

**Learners**: Postsecondary administrators responsible for IPEDS reporting

**Learning Objective**:
1. Learners will be able to define and apply Social Interdependence Theory principles within a group data reporting context.
2. Learners will be able to complete the IPEDS Graduation Rates survey in a collaborative setting with defined roles and responsibilities.
3. Learners will be able to reflect on group performance and individual contributions.

**Instructional Strategies**
• **Group Goals & Shared Responsibility**: Tasks are framed around a collective outcome where each member's input is essential.
• **Positive Interdependence**: Assign complementary roles such as Data Checker, Category Lead, Submission Manager, and Presenter.
• **Individual Accountability**: Require each member to submit a brief reflection on their role’s contributions.
• **Role Rotation**: Rotate responsibilities in multi-step activities to ensure varied experiences.
• **Jigsaw Method**: Teams split into subgroups to master and then teach different sections of the IPEDS survey.
• **Promotive Interaction**: Encourage face-to-face or synchronous virtual discussions during data classification.
• **Group Reflection**: Debrief on group communication, problem-solving, and role effectiveness.
• **Conflict Navigation Practice**: Simulate disagreements over classification to model constructive resolution.
• **Flipped Content**: Assign pre-reading on IPEDS structure so class time can focus on collaborative work.

**Learning Activities**
• **Role-Based Group IPEDS Task**: Teams complete a fictional institution’s Graduation Rates Survey with each member performing a unique role. → Assesses: All objectives
• **Jigsaw IPEDS Deep Dive**: Subgroups analyze different reporting sections, then regroup to teach and finalize the full survey. → Assesses: Define & Apply theory principles, Complete survey collaboratively
• **Conflict Resolution Simulation**: Pairs role-play a classification disagreement and model a positive resolution. → Supports: Apply theory principles
• **Group Reflection & Debrief**: Discuss how the team functioned, individual contributions, and group success in completing the survey. → Assesses: Reflect on performance

---

**Assessment Methods**
Formative:
→ Assesses all objectives
• Observations during group work and role execution
• Peer feedback on team contributions
• Reflective journals

Summative:
→ Assesses all objectives
• Final group submission of the Graduation Rates Survey
• Group presentation explaining decision-making and application of Social Interdependence Theory
• Individual reflection submission

---

**Evaluation of Training Impact**
• Post-training surveys measuring perceived clarity, usefulness of collaboration, and satisfaction with group process
• Analysis of group reflections for indicators of collaborative growth
• Follow-up after 1–2 months to check on use of group strategies in real reporting

**EXPLANATION OF INSTRUCTION**
This lesson applies Social Interdependence Theory by focusing instruction around **group goals**, **shared responsibility**, and **structured collaboration**. Learners don’t just complete a task. They **work interdependently** to meet a common objective, with each role carrying a part of the load. Assigning **defined responsibilities** reinforces **individual accountability**, while **jigsaw** and **group reflection** give learners the chance to process what they contributed and how the team functioned as a whole. To ensure **positive interdependence** from the start, learners are placed in assigned teams for the first round, with **Role-Based Rotation** built in to support fairness and inclusion. For subsequent activities, learners may request one peer they'd like to work with, striking a balance between autonomy and equity.

To keep the session focused and meaningful, **flipped content** is used so that foundational concepts are covered ahead of time and class time can emphasize **promotive interaction**. During the lesson, learners use real-world data to apply their understanding in hands-on ways. A brief **conflict navigation practice** gives learners a chance to build **interpersonal and social skills** and rehearse what to do when communication breaks down. This structure not only helps learners gain a stronger grasp of IPEDS reporting, it also teaches them how collaboration, communication, and shared accountability drive success.
